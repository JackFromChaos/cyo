*A way out... there has to be a way out...*

You shuffle blindly to your feet. Everything is inky blackness. You have felt every slimy inch of this cell before.

*Something... anything... please... *

You feel something warm and soft, and immediately a sharp pain shoots through your arm.

*"Augh!"*

*A spider?*

You hear noise in the hallway. Suddenly, the metal door clangs open, a white, blinding light pouring in.

"OK," you hear a voice say. There are people around you. You hear boots. The pain in your eyes is incredible. "Nice and easy now."
