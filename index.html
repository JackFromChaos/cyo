        <page intro="">
            <p>You're in a spooky forest.</p>
            <p>"You'll never get out of here alive," says Smeemog, the grumpy dwarf.</p>
            <p>"I'll show you who won't get out of here alive," you say, but deep down, you're worried he's right.</p>
            <button choice stay-put="">Wait to get rescued</button>
            <button choice look-around>We must explore this magic forest</button>

            <p>"We should wait here until we get rescued."</p>
            <p>"Thought it might be snakes, or maybe a pit, but I never thought I'd be <i>bored</i> to death."</p>
            <p>In the clearing of the forest, there are three rocks, a tree, and, in another tree, a preposterous-looking owl.</p>
            <button choice="" investigate-rocks="">I ought to investigate these rocks</button>
            <button choice="" check-tree-out>I want to check out this tree</button>

        </page>
        <page talk-to-owl="">
            <p>For a while you talk to the owl. It seems to ignore you. Suddenly, it cocks its head towards a hollow in an old tree.</p>
            <p>You reach inside, and pull out a mysterious wooden flute.</p>
            <event got-flute=""></event>
            <p>"Hmm, now I've seen everything".</p>
            <button choice taunt-owl>I ought to taunt that preposterous owl.</button>
            <button choice look-around>Let's get moving.</button>
        </page>
        <page taunt-owl>
            <p>One thing about yourself that you know for sure - you hate owls/</p>
            <p>"Hey! Owl! You're stupid-looking!"</p>
            <p>The owl cocks its head at you bemusedly.</p>
            <p>What a stupid owl, you laugh.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, the owl swoops down and carries you off. It is a big owl indeed.</p>
            <p><i>You are never seen again.</i></p>
            <button restart>Play again?</button>
