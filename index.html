  	<h1>CYO</h1>
  	<h2>Introduction</h2>
  	<p>
  		Inspired by those ol'-fashioned, choose-your-own adventure books, CYO (Choose Your Own) is a declarative framework for creating the same kind of experience on the web, with added features that you just couldn't get right in the old paperback books.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		CYO is used to make choose your own adventure games. You don't need to know any JavaScript at all to use it.
  	</p>
  	<h2>Examples</h2>

  	<h2>Usage</h2>
  	<p>
  		CYO is a nearly all-directive library. To gain access to the directive, simply require the module as a dependency of your angular app.
